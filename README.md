A LÖVE game by Altom game about supernatural Robin Hood-ism, class struggle and optimal economic systems.
Initially done for the March 2012 Experimental Gameplay Project (Theme: ECONOMY)

What's working now?
-------------------

The game is somewhat playable. Meaning there's a basic interface, most of the game logic, a help text and barely enough graphics to make the game understandable.

What's left?
------------
The game is currently in alpha.

What's left for beta: some more graphics, an entire soundbase, balance, and some functionalities (mostly a shop)

What's left for 1.0: Configurable balance (i.e. "easy/medium/hard"), more balance and better graphics and sounds. Maybe some storyline.
