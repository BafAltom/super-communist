## In a nutshell

A LÖVE game by Altom game about supernatural Robin Hood-ism, class struggle and optimal economic systems.
Initially done for the March 2012 Experimental Gameplay Project (Theme: ECONOMY), but continued on the side because it's fun!

## What's working now?

The game is somewhat playable. Meaning there's a basic interface, most of the game logic, a help text and barely enough graphics to make the game understandable.

## How do I play?

Because the game is still in development, there is no installer.
However you can build and play it from source using this guide:

1. Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) and [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the `love-sublime-build.sh` (on Linux) or `love-sublime-build.bat` (on Windows) script from the repository folder

## Dream features

This was supposed to be a small game, but I like to add things to it when I'm bored. (Vaguely) planned features are:

-   Super-nice graphics
-   Super-nice sounds
-   Super-well-designed balance
    -   Economic balance (i.e. the game will always rebalance itself)
    -   A shop which does not destroy the economic balance
    -   Well-designed items to sell through the shop
-   Super-emotionally-profound storyline
