What's working now?
-------------------

The game is sorta-playable. Meaning there's a basic interface, most of the game logic, a help text and barely enough graphics to make the game understandable.

What's left?
------------
In my understanding of it, the game is still in "alpha".

What's left for beta: some more graphics, an entire soundbase, balance, and some functionalities (mostly a shop)
What's left for "1.0": Configurable balance (i.e. "easy/medium/hard"), more balance and better graphics and sounds. Maybe some storyline.
