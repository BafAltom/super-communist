In a nutshell
-------------

A LÖVE game by Altom game about supernatural Robin Hood-ism, class struggle and optimal economic systems.
Initially done for the March 2012 Experimental Gameplay Project (Theme: ECONOMY), but continued on the side because it's fun!

What's working now?
-------------------

The game is somewhat playable. Meaning there's a basic interface, most of the game logic, a help text and barely enough graphics to make the game understandable.

Dream features
--------------

This was supposed to be a small game, but I like to add things to it when I'm bored. (Vaguely) planned features are:

- Super-nice graphics
- Super-nice sounds
- Super-well-designed balance
    + Economic balance (i.e. the game will always rebalance itself)
    + A shop which does not destroy the economic balance
    + Well-designed items to sell through the shop
- Super-emotionally-profound storyline
