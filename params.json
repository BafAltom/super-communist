Meaning there's a basic interface, most of the game logic, a help text and barely enough graphics to make the game understandable.\r\n\r\nWhat's left?\r\n------------\r\nThe game is currently in alpha.\r\n\r\nWhat's left for beta: some more graphics, an entire soundbase, balance, and some functionalities (mostly a shop)\r\n\r\nWhat's left for 1.0: Configurable balance (i.e. \"easy/medium/hard\"), more balance and better graphics and sounds. Maybe some storyline.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
