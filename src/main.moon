-- SUPER CÃ–MMUNIST
-- A game by Altom for the March 2012 Experimental Gameplay Project (Theme: ECONOMY)

-- Begun : Sunday March 4th (supposed worktime: 7 days, delay: still counting)

-- RANDOM IDEAS:
-- - "Godly events" : Economy crash, Oil pit, Technology : try to balance the economy online
-- - Shop items:
--   o heart containers
--   o VIVA LA REVOLUTION (poor attack rich for x minutes)
--   o ...
-- - Refactor : make methods in player, ui, world, etc? use the standard "inst.foo(inst, param)" to be called with "inst:foo(param)"
--

-- this is to enable live console output in Sublime Text
io.stdout\setvbuf'no'
